RichWPS client API
==============

This library is a standalone WPS client API based on the 52North WPS implementation. It does not have 52n server dependencies any more.

#Configuration
The client API is configured by registrated 52n parsers and generators inside the datahandlers section in the [wps_client_config.xml](https://github.com/richwps/wps-client-api/blob/master/src/main/resources/wps_client_config.xml).

The configuration itself is defined in the artifact org.n52.wps:52n-wps-client-config:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT (see [clientconfig branch](https://github.com/richwps/wps-config/tree/clientconfig))

# Usage
Please refer to the [WPS Client API Tutorial](http://52north.org/communities/geoprocessing/wps/tutorials/ClientAPI.html )
